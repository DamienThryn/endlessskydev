She talks as quickly as she walks. "Let's save the pleasantries for the flight. My name is Chimamanda Ngozi, and I need you to get me to Hai-Home as quickly as possible. Our company is prepared to pay you 150,000 credits to get me there as quickly as you can manage."`

Part of our contract specifies that we are liable for the actions of any miscreants who make it into Hai territory on one of our transports, so we work hard to thoroughly vet everyone we send through Waypoint. I can tell you more on the flight, but I would prefer that we get going immediately. Too many delays in space travel, and there is a lot to get done before I can go home to Luna."`

			`	During the time you spend jumping through the empty systems on the way to Hai space, Chimamanda briefs you on Hi-Urth's activities in Hai space. It appears that several decades ago, the Hai decided to deal with the problem of what was then random pulses of immigration by sponsoring a group of entrepreneurs who were familiar with Hai culture to form a company in human space dedicated to identifying and recruiting "interesting, educated, and friendly!" humans who would be transported en masse, along with any possessions, to live permanently among the Hai. They reasoned that purposefully constructing an integrated Hai-Human society on several minor worlds would make it easier to integrate future migrants into Hai culture.`
			`	You aren't certain you like the idea of more-or-less engineering a society, but you end up agreeing with Chimamanda that if nothing else, the Hi-Urth initiative has been very effective at staying under the radar. despite, she claims "more than sixty percent of emigrants to Hai space having done so on ships chartered by Hi-Urth."`

			`You safely reach Hai-Home and drop off Chimamanda, who is greeted at the spaceport by half a dozen important looking Hai. They whisk her away without paying any attention to you, but you check your accounts and verify that <payment> was deposited.`

Which will mean that, if you have enough bunk space available, we can contract you to transport emigrants and their belongings from their homes in the deep or on the paradise worlds to Hai territory. Naturally, because of the discretion our charter captains must demonstrate in order to take these jobs, the payments will be quite competitive."`
